Rackspace |product name| API |contract version|
===============================================

*Last updated:* |today|

The |product name| service enables developers to programmatically view and
manage their existing dedicated hardware load balancer resources such as
virtual IPs (vips), nodes and health checks. You cannot use the API to
provision dedicated hardware load balancers.

The |apiservice| enables you to manage the following load balancer types.

- |F5| manages load balancing for applications that scale up
  or down.

- |ADX| manages traffic between dedicated and cloud servers.

.. note::

   For details about load balancer types, see
   :how-to:`Using dedicated load balancers with RackConnect v2.0\
